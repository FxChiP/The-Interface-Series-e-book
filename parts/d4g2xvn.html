<div class="md"><p>The remnant ember of a dying star</p>

<p>drifts along the galactic fringe,</p>

<p>companioned solely</p>

<p>by a tiny world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the planet&#39;s surface, a great crystal tower </p>

<p>lords over a vast and airless plain.</p>

<p>The cooling star&#39;s blue light</p>

<p>draws the tower&#39;s shadow across the land</p>

<p>and marks the passing of the ages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through the core of the tower</p>

<p>runs an artery of living flesh.</p>

<p>Branching paths of blood</p>

<p>are refracted within facets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the base of the spire</p>

<p>there is no door, no entryway</p>

<p>but at the top</p>

<p>a fleshy orifice</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once or twice an age</p>

<p>for purpose unknown</p>

<p>the tower&#39;s mouth expels a living human,</p>

<p>to fall down and down</p>

<p>through the airless space,</p>

<p>and land atop a scree</p>

<p>of other people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A traveler passing on foot would be forgiven for wondering why so many other travelers</p>

<p>had approached the tower and flung themselves down at its base</p>

<p>to die. </p>

<p>Perhaps it was in prayer.</p>

<p>Or perhaps they were searching</p>

<p>for an entryway</p>

<p>for a door</p>

<p>which doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
