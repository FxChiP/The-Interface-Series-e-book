Watching the *flesh interface* process known as "embrace" is kinda like watching those Japanese subway groping videos. That was honestly the first thing I thought of when I watched it, but of course, I wasn't going to put that in the official report. You ever seen those videos? Oh, you wouldn't admit it if you had, right? It's a whole genre over there. Not the most progressive stuff in terms of gender equality, but compelling nonetheless. The videos start with a woman standing in the subway, minding her own business, when some guy starts feeling her up. She protests demurely and attempts to deflect his roaming hands. He persists. Other men on the subway, perhaps sensing her weakness, join in with the groping. A sort of group madness takes over the subway occupants. The men are transformed from ordinary travelers into a agglomerated mass of arms and hands and fingers, grabbing every part of the woman's body. The woman's attempts at protecting her personal space are always absurdly ineffectual, and soon she is divested of her clothing. Depending on the video's sub-genre, a variety of acts ensue, most of which surely violate local transportation statutes. "Embrace" is kind of like that. That, combined with a school of piranha stripping a live cow of its flesh.
