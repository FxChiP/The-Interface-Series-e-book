<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always found Lisa&#39;s Dream to be a good starting place when trying to understand the psychological effects of &quot;travel.&quot;</p>

<p>Lisa was a 9 year old girl sent through the Groom Lake interface in 1975. The Groom Lake interface connects to the so-called Sister City (technically, &quot;persistent locus&quot;) known as &quot;The Hanging Temples&quot;. She stayed there for 5 days of normal-time, but only 48 seconds of beyond-time, a marked discrepancy. Upon returning, she did not recall anything beyond becoming drowsy for a moment. She slept well that night, and in the morning she recounted a dream to the doctors, before dying later in the day.</p>

<p>A direct transcript of the audio from her interview:</p>

<p>&quot;It was spring and it had been raining all day, but the rain stopped just before it was going to be sunset. So all the clouds were purply and the sky was really orange. And the grass was all wet with rain and there were fire flies around, like all in the sky, way up in the sky, big ones. And me and my grandma went out to these hills way out past the edge of town, and under the hills there were people sleeping. Not in caves. They were buried under the hills. The people were asleep but they were hugging each other. Families, like moms and dads and little kids. Just packed together, a few thousand. The hills were just blown up like balloons because they were so full of people. Like a pregnant woman&#39;s stomach. My grandma told me to lie down but I didn&#39;t want to. She laid down and got sucked into the ground. I heard her voice coming out of the ground telling me to come inside.&quot;</p>
