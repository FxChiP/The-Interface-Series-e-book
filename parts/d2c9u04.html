<div class="md"><p>The Soviets designated large portions of the Ukraine countryside as &quot;harvest populations.&quot; Basically, their food and water supplies were dosed with LSD until they had achieved what the Soviets called &quot;integration&quot;. This meant that the local populations had independently invented <strong>flesh interfaces</strong>. The Soviet army would then quarantine the area and try to remove the flesh interfaces for their own use. This was usually without success and with great loss of life.</p>

<p>Many of the soldiers and scientists were segmented, as often happens in an incident zone. So they ended up with people missing limbs, cut in half, etc. What&#39;s interesting is that the people could live for quite some time despite segmentation. This is what led the Soviets to believe that their missing body parts still existed albeit in some unknown place. So one one of the leading theories of the time was interdimensionality. Quite mistaken.</p>
