<div class="md"><p>After the orbital arrays incinerated the city, they dropped our platoon in to take a look around.</p>

<p>We had seen it before. An endless graveyard. Everything ashes. Ash buildings. Ash people.</p>

<p>For six days, we trudged through the dead city before finding the first sign of life.</p>

<p>On the edge of the blast zone, before frozen winter fields, a small flowering bush.</p>

<p>Perhaps the heat of the bombardment had tricked it into blooming early.</p>

<p>We all looked at it for a silent moment and quickly moved on.</p>

<p>We were young and tired and just miles from the rendezvous. </p>

<p>Yet sometimes at night that silent moment returns.</p>

<p>And I see them fluttering again.</p>

<p>In the cold uncaring wind.</p>

<p>Doomed flowers.</p>

<p>Soft and pale.</p>
