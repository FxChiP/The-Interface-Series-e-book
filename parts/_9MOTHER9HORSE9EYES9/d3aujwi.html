<div class="md"><p>Ha hum. I love waking up in the morning to the smell of fresh biscuits. The warm smell fills my dreams, a smell like friends and home and happiness. I wake up to see the sun so bright and lovely in my window. Hello day! How are you? Every day is bright and cheery when you share a house with your best friends. I can hear them downstairs singing and having fun. After a long night of spooky old dreams, it&#39;s good to be awake again in the cheery deary sunlight.</p>

<p>I unlock my bedroom door and go out into the hall. Some of my friends have left fresh piles of biscuits in the hallway, several different kinds. Wonderful! I breathe in the smell and make chirpy little sounds of glee. Heeheehee. Another day!</p>

<p>Chester Barrington comes up the stairs, looking very handsome and somber in his tuxedo.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Chester!&quot; I sing. &quot;How is the gentleman today?&quot;</p>

<p>Chester nods to me, gruff but debonair. &quot;Proceedings are afoot, Madam Alice. Proceedings are afoot,&quot; he grumbles and makes his way down the hallway. That Chester. So self-serious.</p>

<p>On the stairway, Brett Turlingshire and Mansy Fairworth are in each other&#39;s arms, a lover&#39;s embrace.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; I cry. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve interrupted your tryst!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, madam, nonsense. This is no tryst. This is a destined love affair!&quot; Brett proclaims in his ringing voice. He looks dashing in his fine, striped coat.</p>

<p>&quot;Brett, darling, Madam Alice doesn&#39;t want to hear all that gooey talk,&quot; Mansy says in her sassy southern accent. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll leave you two be,&quot; I say lifting the hem of my nightgown and hurrying past them.</p>

<p>When I get to the bottom of the stairs, I hear Brett murmur, &quot;I wish the Madam would find a destined love affair of her own. She is a noble woman and deserves somebody to treat her well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You just worry about treating me well,&quot; Mansy purrs, nuzzling against his cheek.</p>

<p>I scurry off before they catch me listening. In the downstairs parlor, Raymond Decks, Montrose Pardonsmith and Elise Rapier are having tea together. The smell of biscuits fills the room. A fresh heap of toffee-colored scones covers the coffee table. A wonderful selection of pastries lies in the corner, and several of the chairs contain more treats.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello dearies! How are we today?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can&#39;t complain,&quot; Raymond says.</p>

<p>&quot;Splendid!&quot; Sir Pardonsmith intones.</p>

<p>Elise merely lets out a little sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;Elise, are we not feeling well?&quot; I ask, coming over to where she is perched on the arm of the couch.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh. Should we be? Life is but a vague dream which disrupts the sleep of death,&quot; she murmurs in her smoky French accent.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Elise. Must you be such an existentialist?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Je ne suis pas un existentialiste,&quot; she mutters, getting up and stalking off.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor Elise,&quot; I say as she leaves the room.</p>

<p>&quot;She is affected by that peculiar continental ennui,&quot; Sir Pardonsmith observes. &quot;I say she needs a dose of sturdy American optimism.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her birthday is coming soon. Perhaps we should throw her a party,&quot; I suggest.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! A party for Elise? That would go over like a Bar Mitzvah for Goebbels,&quot; Raymond says.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Raymond!&quot; I say, tousling his orange hair. &quot;Well, we&#39;ll have to figure out something for her. I don&#39;t like her moping about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She&#39;s an inveterate mope. There&#39;s no changing her,&quot; Raymond says.</p>

<p>&quot;You may be right, sir,&quot; I say, sighing. Well, c&#39;est la vie. Not everybody can be as happy as I am.</p>

<p>Some years ago, I was much like Elise. Down the dumps. A real gray cloud. Then I met a lovely young woman who happened to be passing through my neighborhood. Her name was Angelica. It had been a long time since I had enjoyed the delights of society, but Angelica had a very mature, soothing presence, despite her youth. I lived a large house where my family had once resided but was now empty, so I asked her to stay with me. She accepted just like that. Can you imagine it? Two strangers just making a home together? It must have been kismet.</p>

<p>She was my precious angel treasure. Absolutely heaven sent. I had been something of an existentialist myself, disbelieving in God and thinking his creation a cruel trap for human prey. But then he saw it fit to bring Angelica into my life, and I never doubted him again. I found her company such a balm that I decided to open my home to whoever needed a place to stay. Singletons, couples, whole families have stayed with me. Many children have been born in this house.</p>

<p>Though dear sweet Angelica has long since passed way, her friendship is still a daily gift to me. For on the day I met her, I made a choice to simply not feel sadness or worry or fear ever again. And I haven&#39;t. Do you think it impossible? It is possible, if you simply surround yourself with loved ones. That&#39;s the secret.</p>

<p>With all these thoughts in mind, I walk into the kitchen to see Reginald Strongton, Linda Mercychowder and Marshall Futz clamoring for their breakfast.</p>

<p>&quot;Madam, I&#39;m famished!&quot; Reginald cries.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear Madam! We starve! We want! We waste away!&quot; Linda says in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, mercy. I left you with a kingly feast last night. Have you eaten it all?&quot; I ask.</p>

<p>&quot;It was not us. We had not a bite. It was that Chester Barrington, the scoundrel!&quot; Reginald cries. &quot;He is voracious and utterly selfish. I found him down here, helping himself to your generosity, and when I tried to serve myself the smallest morsel, he attacked me. Attacked me, madam! My nose still smarts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that Chester does have an appetite. But I find it hard to believe such a gentleman would attack you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, I am on the verge of swooning,&quot; Marshall croaks.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, dears, let&#39;s have ourselves a proper breakfast,&quot; I say.</p>

<p>I get a bag of cuisine from the cabinet and pour it into china bowls for Reginald, Linda, and Marshall and myself. I clear off the love-biscuits that somebody left on the kitchen table, and we all sit down to eat. My little friends immediately proceed with chowing down, and I am about to follow suit, but I notice something that brings me a wonderful thrill.</p>

<p>There is a stranger standing in the doorway to the kitchen. I have never seen her before. She appears to have snuck into the house alone. She stands there, tense and alert, her yellow eyes taking in the scene. I am breathless. She is beautiful, extraordinary, exquisite. She reminds me of my sweet Angelica. Oh, lovely day! I am about to have a new friend!</p>
