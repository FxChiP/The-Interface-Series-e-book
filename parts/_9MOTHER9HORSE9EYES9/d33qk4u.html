<p>General Castillo is gone.</p>

<p>She made a real flash narrative. She was clever. She got a lot farther than any of us had any right to. </p>

<p>But Q smelled her. Q slew her proxies. Q localized her.</p>

<p>Q funneled her paths to one.</p>

<p>Disconnection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It hurts. She was the last of &quot;the bred.&quot; Our best hope.</p>

<p>The ultimate soldiers fighting the final war.</p>

<p>She and the other children were supposed to be the answer to Q.</p>

<p>But there was no answer to Q.</p>

<p>There never will be.</p>

<p>Not after ten trillion heat deaths.</p>

<p>Not if every particle in the universe became a transistor</p>

<p>And they all cycled together</p>

<p>And the stones themselves cried out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The war of the mind is lost.</p>

<p>We lost it.</p>

<p>Now begins the plague.</p>

<p>The plague of the flesh.</p>
