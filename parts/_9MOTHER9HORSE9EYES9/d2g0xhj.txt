When I was little, they took mommy away and put me with a new mommy in a smelly dark house.

They said she was a real person, but I knew she wasn't. They had made her.

Her face was made from pieces of animal.

* pig cheeks

* hairy goat jaw

* old horse eyes

They sewed her together badly, and the seams were crusty. I hated her.

Real mommy called me from underground. I opened the attic window at sundown and let the spring breeze flow in. I heard her song floating in on the cool air, soft singing from the grave.
