<div class="md"><p>Basically, when you look at the stories of Elizabeth Bathory&#39;s behavior, it seems like she is trying to build a <em>flesh interface</em>. But it is known that in order to invent a <em>flesh interface</em>, one must be under the influence of LSD for extended periods. As LSD hadn&#39;t been invented during her life, it&#39;s probably just a coincidence. Still a tantalizing theory, though.</p>
