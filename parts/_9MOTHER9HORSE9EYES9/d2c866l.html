<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised they used nuclear subs in the Falklands, considering the battle&#39;s proximity to the undersea incident zone surrounding the so-called Artigas portal. As I understand it, the portal was opened because of experiments taking place in the CIA&#39;s antarctic station in the early 80s, and Falklands quickly became a center for portal research.</p>

<p>Being underwater, the portal had an enormous incident zone, and segmented whales and other undersea debris would regularly wash up on the islands&#39; shores. They found one whale that had been segmented cleanly in half by an incident zone disturbance, proving a perfect cross section of the creature. They also found hundreds of the &quot;chitinous cruciform&quot; creatures, certainly non-terrestrial in origin.</p>

<p>Anyways, if a nuclear sub had wandered into the incident zone, it could have been disastrous, but I guess they considered the risk acceptable.</p>
