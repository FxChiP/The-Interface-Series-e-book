<div class="md"><p>Obviously I can&#39;t define a <em>flesh interface</em> in terms of purpose or composition or mechanism. I can only list the various phenomena which are related to them. Chief among these is the creation of an incident zone wherein objects are spontaneously segmented i.e. parts of the objects simply disappear, yet the objects continue to behave as if the missing parts are still present.</p>

<p>Also, you see complex tunnels created in the earth. These have been termed &quot;ant farms&quot;. In undersea <em>interfaces</em>, you get chitinous cruciform organisms. These sui generis organisms are thought to be the result on evolutionary processes which took place in an environment other than earth. This is speculation, but in this case, I agree with it. Then there have been the giant metallic cylinders which appear and experience continuous spontaneous segmentation. These are usually at least 10 meters in diameter and can get much larger, and only occur in very large <em>interfaces</em> i.e. <em>portals</em>.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the phenomena are too various to mention, and different for each interface.</p>
