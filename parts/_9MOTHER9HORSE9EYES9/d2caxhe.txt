Dubai probably has the highest rate of free-floating non-*interface* incidents of any major metropolitan area in the world. In one incident, a large group of migrant workers was segmented in an underground facility. Perfect cross-sectional segmentation along the frontal plane. You could see their lungs working, food being digested, blood pumping on the inside of the heart, everything. They live for almost 5 months in this condition. Absolutely fascinating to see in person.

There was also a group of school children who were very slightly segmented, just ends of figures and bits of the calves and such. Hardly fatal wounds, yet they all died within 2 months. Some showed signs of intellectual mutation.

There are no known *flesh interfaces* in Dubai. However, it is surmised that the architecture is actually based on *interface* geometry and carries some latent *interface*-like power. Mass segmentations remain one of the most mysterious aspects of the *interfaces*. They seem to show that the interfaces do indeed concentrate on flesh, living up to their name.
