<div class="md"><p>When I was little, they took mommy away and put me with a new mommy in a smelly dark house.</p>

<p>They said she was a real person, but I knew she wasn&#39;t. They had made her.</p>

<p>Her face was made from pieces of animal.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>pig cheeks</p></li>
<li><p>hairy goat jaw</p></li>
<li><p>old horse eyes</p></li>
</ul>

<p>They sewed her together badly, and the seams were crusty. I hated her.</p>

<p>Real mommy called me from underground. I opened the attic window at sundown and let the spring breeze flow in. I heard her song floating in on the cool air, soft singing from the grave.</p>
