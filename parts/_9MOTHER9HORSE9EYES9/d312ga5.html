<div class="md"><p>I call it &quot;coming back online.&quot;</p>

<p>That moment when you first come out of drunken blackout. It&#39;s always frightening. Where am I? What is this neighborhood? What happened to my face? Where&#39;s my wallet? Some people, when they drink enough to disable their short term memory, immediately collapse into an immobile heap. This is nature&#39;s failsafe. But I lack this feature. I can walk and talk and carry a tune, yet have no idea of what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>I have never come back online to find myself up to any good. I have never emerged from a blackout to find that I have built a convenient spice rack or delivered a moving speech about women&#39;s rights. It&#39;s always been some fucking calamity.</p>

<p>The last time I came back online, I was standing in my front yard having a conversation with my parents. Even in my tottering state, I knew this couldn&#39;t be a good thing. I had no idea what we were talking about. Why were we talking about it on the front lawn? At night? What time was it? Hoping for a clue, I waited for something to come out of my mouth. And here it was: &quot;Didn&#39;t you notice I never left my room? I&#39;ve been living with you for 6 months. I think I&#39;ve seen each of you twice.&quot;</p>

<p>This was bad. I knew I shouldn&#39;t be saying something like this. It sounded terribly confessional. Ever since I had gotten fired and moved back in with my parents, I had been holed in my childhood bedroom, secretly drinking and basking in an unremitting sense of personal shame. But this was all supposed to be a secret. As far as my parents knew, I was freelancing and &quot;getting back on my feet.&quot; This scene, this mad scene, was not part of that narrative.</p>

<p>&quot;We were giving you your privacy. We didn&#39;t know you were getting drunk up there,&quot; my mother said.</p>

<p>This conversation was out of control. I should just tell them I&#39;m going to bed. I should calmly bid them a good night. So I said, &quot;Of course I was getting drunk! Fuck! I&#39;ve been drinking every goddamn day for the last ten years! What the fuck else would I be doing?&quot;</p>

<p>This was a poor choice of words. This was not how one calmly bids others a good night. Oh, the look on my poor mother&#39;s face...</p>

<p>That look stayed with me. That look, the fallen face of a tired old woman, stayed with me as I lay in bed that night. It stayed with me as  the alcohol wore off, as the night turned into queasy morning, as the hands began to shake, the &quot;brain tingle&quot; set in, as the &quot;hell whispers&quot; began, as I waited for them to go to work so I could sneak a bit of relief from the liquor cabinet, as the awful day wore on, as we talked that night, as I packed my stuff up, as I went off to rehab the next day. </p>

<p>My mother is almost 70. She&#39;s small and stooped and old. When did she get so old?</p>

<p>I just thought I would be something by now. 33 years old. I thought I would have something to show her, something to give back, something to make her proud. I thought I&#39;d be a man. Not just a drunken failure. All those little soccer practices she took me to, all the swim lessons and therapy and errands and effort and love. What was it for? So I could be a drunken sack of shit? Why was I so fucked up? Why did I require shore-leave levels of liquor to operate properly?</p>

<p>As I lay in bed in the rehab that first night, listening to the occasional moans of the other patients, I asked myself these questions and others. Soon, I found myself returning to the question I had been asking my entire life, the one I always retreated to in moments of self-pity, the one that seemed hold some key to my dysfunction. The one I had always been afraid to ask my mom.</p>

<p>What about that one summer when you were dead?</p>
