<div class="md"><p>This kind of psychological mirroring was exploited in the design of the <em>flesh interfaces</em>. When a human body is embedded in an interface, the independent (i.e. non-human) interface glands produce massive amounts of LSD which cause intellectual mutations (i.e. time-fracturing along several dozen axes). Meanwhile, independent hormone regulators produce a emotional oscillation between two states:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>euphoria</p></li>
<li><p>terror</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thus we have the typical sound of an interface: alternating waves of giggling and screaming that move through the interface population, running along the length of the interface as the hormones travel along the independent conduits. These successive waves of giggling and screaming create a steady rhythm that washes over the traveler as they move through the interface. Natural empathetic responses (mirroring) prepare the traveler&#39;s body for the process of &quot;embrace.&quot;</p>
