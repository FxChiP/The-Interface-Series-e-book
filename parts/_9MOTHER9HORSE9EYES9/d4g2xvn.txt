The remnant ember of a dying star

drifts along the galactic fringe,

companioned solely

by a tiny world.

&nbsp;

On the planet's surface, a great crystal tower 

lords over a vast and airless plain.

The cooling star's blue light

draws the tower's shadow across the land

and marks the passing of the ages.

&nbsp;

Through the core of the tower

runs an artery of living flesh.

Branching paths of blood

are refracted within facets.

&nbsp;

At the base of the spire

there is no door, no entryway

but at the top

a fleshy orifice

&nbsp;

Once or twice an age

for purpose unknown

the tower's mouth expels a living human,

to fall down and down

through the airless space,

and land atop a scree

of other people.

&nbsp;

A traveler passing on foot would be forgiven for wondering why so many other travelers

had approached the tower and flung themselves down at its base

to die. 

Perhaps it was in prayer.

Or perhaps they were searching

for an entryway

for a door

which doesn't exist.
