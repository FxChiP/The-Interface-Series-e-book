<p>Rachel does not dream. Rachel does not sleep. Rachel does not wake.</p>

<p>Rachel feels! All the time!</p>

<p>Rachel Head has a direct sense feed with Reinhardt Emotive FPS Blending™ for stunning clarity and total sensory presence. With the entire cultural library at her fingertips, Rachel can put herself into any scenario and create precision mixes at speed-of-mind. Watch as she blends Beethoven&#39;s 5th Symphony with the asteroid orbital catalogue, the 2018 World Cup game and the hot new anal cumming video from Angelica Eleenya.</p>

<p>What mastery!</p>

<p>See the subtle crafting and non-stuttering blends?</p>

<p>That&#39;s because Reinhardt&#39;s proprietary technology blend-splits 240 visual FPS on the fly to create an eye-popping visual stream of over 1000 FPS, while simultaneously delivering 60 tactile FPS and 60 olfactory FPS. Now this is salvation!</p>

<p>But, hey, forget the specs. Check out the feelings! Her Holocaust Child Victim Disco Muscle Thumps have walls around the world shedding tears and making those real feels. You can&#39;t fake this stuff! Are you tired of distant, deadened emotions? Reinhardt Emotive FPS Blending™ give you realistic, immersive feelings, without excess rumination or thought-linger. This kind of subtlety just isn&#39;t possible at ordinary 240 FPS. That&#39;s the difference for Rachel. That can be the difference for you.</p>

<p>Rachel does not dream. Rachel does not sleep. Rachel does not live. Rachel does not die.</p>

<p>Rachel feels.</p>

<p>Can you?</p>
