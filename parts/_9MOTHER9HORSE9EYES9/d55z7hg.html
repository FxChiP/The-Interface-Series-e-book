<div class="md"><p>As soon as I see the car I rush downstairs. Mother is in the kitchen making noises but I run right by her. Outside, the car pulls into the driveway. I run to it smiling but I slow down. Something is different about the car. Whose car is this?</p>

<p>The door opens. I stop. Dad gets out. He&#39;s got that grumpy look he usually has. He&#39;s wearing his pajamas but they have no buttons. Mom gets out of the car too. She comes out of the same door. She&#39;s wearing her blue dress. I start to cry and run to her and hug her legs. She pats my head and says, &quot;There, there, Nick. It&#39;s OK.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where did you go?&quot; I ask. I am crying like a baby. &quot;Why did you leave me? Why did you go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We went to the store,&quot; mom says.</p>

<p>&quot;But you were gone so long,&quot; I say. My face is smushed up against her side.</p>

<p>&quot;We went to the store and bought some dresses and dad got some stuff for his car.&quot;</p>

<p>I look up at her. Her face is all blurry because I am crying. I wipe my face. She looks down at me smiling. Her face is smooth and glowing. &quot;We stayed at the store a few days,&quot; she says and pats me on the head.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to me. &quot;Why did you leave me with the monster lady?&quot; I ask.</p>

<p>Mom stops smiling. &quot;Monster?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s a monster in the house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nick,&quot; she says like she thinks I&#39;m telling stories.</p>

<p>&quot;You weren&#39;t at the store for three days! Where were you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nick,&quot; my dad says in his grumpy voice. &quot;That&#39;s enough.&quot;</p>

<p>I look at him. The shape of his face is weird. He usually has freckles on his cheeks but they&#39;re not in the right places. I let go of mom and look at her. She makes a little smile like she always does when she sees me. It&#39;s her. It&#39;s mom. It&#39;s her face. But it&#39;s too... What&#39;s wrong with it?</p>

<p>Mom&#39;s shirt moves. There&#39;s something underneath it. It&#39;s pushing and trying to get out. I step back. Her face sags like a water balloon and her cheek falls off. It hits the ground right in front of me with a big wet smack. It&#39;s lying there just like a big raw piece of chicken.</p>

<p>I scream and mom falls apart. Her face falls to pieces and her whole body hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. The same thing happens to dad. Their clothes are just lying on the driveway but there&#39;s something inside the clothes moving around inside. I scream and something screams back. It screams again, a little scream, and pokes its head out of my mom&#39;s dress. A kitty cat. </p>

<p>Other cats slip out of the bottom of the dress and out of my dad&#39;s pajamas. A whole bunch of cats all different colors. Mom and dad&#39;s clothes just blow away like tissue and the driveway is full of cats and pieces of meat. A few cats run away. Some of them cry. Some wander around and sniff and lick at the meat.</p>

<p>Something pinches my shoulder and I scream. It&#39;s Mother&#39;s crab hand. She yanks my arm and drags me back to the house. I shout and scream but she holds me tight. She slams the front door shut and pushes me into a big metal cage in the kitchen. Her birds are pushing out her shoulders and her face. They&#39;re missing eyeballs and covered with big golden flies and all of them are tweeting and cackling at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Your magic isn&#39;t strong enough to make whomever you want,&quot; she says in a deep voice.</p>

<p>The birds all giggle. &quot;Never will be!&quot; one of them shouts.</p>
