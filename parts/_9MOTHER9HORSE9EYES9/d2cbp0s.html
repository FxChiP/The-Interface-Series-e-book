<div class="md"><p>We look at Elizabeth Bathory as an example of pre-LSD &quot;enlightenment&quot; i.e. somebody seeming to attempt to build a <em>flesh interface</em> before the invention of LSD.</p>

<p>How can this be explained? Perhaps she ingested some ergot or some other naturally occurring psychotropic chemical. Or perhaps her mind was simply attuned to whatever intellectual processes need to occur to invent a <em>flesh interface</em>. The Book of Revelations is also considered to be a description of a <em>flesh interface</em> especially the description of New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>My problem with this is that it is all speculative. It&#39;s like when modern psychologists diagnose historical figures. I&#39;m uncomfortable with this level of speculation.</p>

<p>I will always regard the first instance of a <em>flesh interface</em> to have occurred in Triblenka, 1944. The geologic disturbances, partial tunnels, so-called interdimensionality, and wealth of clearly segmented bodies leave no doubt of its existence. The Soviets have documented this.</p>
