<div class="md"><p>One time, my mom took me to a clothes store. She was wearing a blue dress and I was following her around. But then I looked up and it wasn&#39;t her. It was some other lady wearing a blue dress I had followed by mistake. I was scared so I ran away from the lady but then I couldn&#39;t find mom. A lady from the store found me crying and took me back to her. I was mad at her because I thought she switched into that lady on purpose to trick me. I was too little to know that&#39;s not possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is it?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wake up by myself and go downstairs for toast and jam but the kitchen is totally empty. I call &quot;Mom! Mom!&quot; but she doesn&#39;t answer. I can&#39;t find anybody. In the TV room there is a stranger sitting in the big chair. Uh-oh. I can only see the back of her head. Gray hair. I sneak away to my room.</p>

<p>Upstairs I check mom and dad&#39;s room and my sisters&#39; room but they&#39;re all empty. Where did they all go? It&#39;s not fair that they all left without me. Anna and Brittany always go places and do things without me. But mom wouldn&#39;t do that. She likes to take me everywhere. We are best friends. So what happened? Maybe they said they were going somewhere and I didn&#39;t listen. Mom always tells me to listen better. Why don&#39;t I?</p>

<p>Wait a minute! Today is Sunday. Usually we go to church on Sunday. Mom and dad go to the grownup church and I go to Sunday school. They must be at church. Last week I told mom that I never ever want to go to church again. Hey! Maybe mom decided to leave me at home just like I told her to. This is great! No stupid Sunday school! All the play-time I want!</p>

<p>I run over to where my toys are piled up in the corner and get all the ones I want. I&#39;ve been playing this great game with my trucks and cars called police vs. firemen. The policemen use their guns and the firemen use their hoses and they even have hoses that shoot fire.</p>

<p>I play for a long time and it&#39;s great but I&#39;m getting more hungry. When will everybody be back? How long is church? It feels like forever when I&#39;m there. It&#39;s so boring and the kids aren&#39;t nice to me. I remember that last week I cried in the car on the way over because I didn&#39;t want to go. Mom was mad. I was really crying like a baby and it was embarrassing.</p>

<p>I always cry too much. Anna and Brittany make fun of me for it because I cry more than them but they are girls. I try not to but I do it anyways.</p>

<p>I wonder about the stranger downstairs. It looked like an old gray-haired lady but I only saw her back. Is she a baby sitter? I decide to go downstairs and get some crackers from the pantry. Mom keeps some on a shelf for me. I go get the crackers and eat them until I&#39;m full.</p>

<p>On my way back I pass by the TV room. That old lady is still sitting there. Her long gray hair is hanging down over the back of the chair. It&#39;s got leaves and little sticks stuck in it. This makes me want to giggle a little bit. What a messy lady! But then I start to get scared thinking about it. I sneak back upstairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s sunset time and I&#39;m hungry again and I&#39;m a lot more scared. Mom and dad and everybody are still gone. What if they don&#39;t come back? What if mom was really mad at me for crying last time and now this is punishment?</p>

<p>Oh no. What if God is mad at me for not going? We&#39;re supposed to go to Sunday school to make God happy and I didn&#39;t go. I was really bad. What if this is a big punishment? God can make people disappear forever.</p>

<p>I get down on my knees and press my hands very tight together and whisper, &quot;I&#39;m sorry God for not going to Sunday school. I will go every time forever until I am dead. I am sorry. I am sorry. Please bring mom and dad and Anna and Brittany back. Thank you God. Amen.&quot;</p>

<p>I get up and run over to my window. I can see the front lawn and the street. It&#39;s all empty. I wait for dad&#39;s car to come down the street. Now they&#39;ll all come back... But nobody comes.</p>

<p>Downstairs, I hear noises. Like a dog growling but so loud. And something banging on the ceiling.</p>

<p>I go into my closet. I cry too much. I always cry too much.</p>
