<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting. When I was working for the CIA, we found that animals could often survive travel through the <em>flesh interfaces</em> much better than humans could. We regularly had success sending dogs and cats through. Somebody hit upon the idea of sending some <em>Gracula religiosa</em> (hill myna) through the interface, because they are adept at imitating sounds. This was the next best thing to sending a tape recorder (the interfaces did not accept non-living objects. We worked on grafting a tape recorder to a turtle, but this was unsuccessful on several levels.)</p>

<p>We sent the birds through, and they returned unencased but covered with the typical fluids. Those of us who subscribed the the alien theory had high hopes that they would record alien speech. Instead (or indeed) they came back imitating a strange flute-like &quot;speech music.&quot; The music was quite interesting, though having all the birds sing at once created <strong>distinctly</strong> unpleasant effect. Somebody in the department ended up killing all the birds, though we never found out who.</p>
