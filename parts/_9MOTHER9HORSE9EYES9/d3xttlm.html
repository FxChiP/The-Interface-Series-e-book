<div class="md"><pre><code>How the flesh dances and how the flesh plays

How the flesh toils and spins through its days

See the flesh happy and strapping and young

See the flesh sagging and dragging and glum
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>Sssssshhhhh....
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>Hear now the giggling

See shadows grow

Step down the hallway

Each door aglow

Watch now the ceiling

Sweet cradle rocks

Who made these puppets?

Who made this clock?
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>Ancient hand on the cradle

Withered lips form a song

Golden wheels spinning backward

Withered hand becomes young
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>The hands can spin

Spin then slow

The clock is wound afresh

But is the key

Turned this time

By fingers made of flesh?
