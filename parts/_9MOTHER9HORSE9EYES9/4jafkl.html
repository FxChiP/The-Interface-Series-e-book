<p>It&#39;s not often you meet a black Jew. It&#39;s even less often that you meet a black Jew who believes in Jesus. And it&#39;s that much rarer to meet an anti-Semitic black Jew who believes in Jesus. That&#39;s gotta win you some kind of fucking prize. That&#39;s like a unicorn throwing a no-hitter. And to be roommates with an anti-Semitic black Jew who believes in Jesus? What a treat! What an absolute delight. Don&#39;t you love it when a disagreement over laundry turns into a 30-minute fact-free lecture about the end of days, FEMA camps and the mark of the beast? lol. Just anti-Semitic black Jew for Jesus things.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t  think I&#39;m going to make it living in this sober house. I can&#39;t live with this nutcase. The house manager says I&#39;m supposed to be open-minded and tolerant. Should I be tolerant of some of the most odious and insane anti-Semitism I&#39;ve ever encountered outside of a nazi rally? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll concede that it is possible that he could become a cool guy, if he only stopped believing in everything he believes in and believed in entirely different things. That would be a good first step.</p>

<p>The real problem is that I hate AA. I fucking hate it. It has the same old bullshit magical beliefs as any cult, but they pretend to be open-minded. It&#39;s just a bait-and-switch to convert you to believing in God. The entire program is nothing but &quot;Let god make you sober.&quot; That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the entire program.</p>

<p>Yeah, they try to distract you with all this pseudo-systemization: 12 steps and 12 traditions and triangles and diagrams and slogans and little self-help exercises, but that&#39;s all just a bunch of numbers and jargon to hide the essential emptiness of the program, to hide the fact that it is centered on a god that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>The idea that this is the go-to program for helping alcoholics is fucking appalling. It&#39;s a fucking crime. It&#39;s like getting cancer and going to the best hospital in the country and the doctor hands you a voodoo doll and tells you to sacrifice a chicken. You&#39;d sue him for malpractice. They should be fucking ashamed of themselves. To prey on people in such a vulnerable state, pretend that they&#39;re going to help them and then try to convert them to their stupid fucking magical beliefs. It&#39;s a crime.</p>

<p>I mean, everybody thinks the True Jew Hebrew guy is nuts, but it&#39;s not like their philosophy is any less bullshit. At least he is upfront about being religious. And he sure as hell isn&#39;t trying to convert me. He told me that white people are the children of Esau. We&#39;re gentiles, but we can still get into heaven if we aid the children of Israel. I let him borrow the charger to my laptop. So I guess I&#39;m covered.</p>
