<div class="md"><p>OK. Now I&#39;m in my bedroom.</p>

<p>The bedroom smells like...bedroom.</p>

<p>Actual bedroom. Oh, so definite.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a smell like wood and blankets and stuff. Sharp. I wonder how they decide on the bedroom smell. I move my arms around and bounce a little on the bedsprings. My body feels really natural and comfortable. Everything looks sharp too. There are no weird color trails like in acclimation. Cool. Really crisp.</p>

<p>I stand up and take in all the little touches. It&#39;s an attic bedroom with a slanting ceiling and wood panel walls. Night outside the window. Mood lighting from a nightstand lamp. Clothes and a skateboard and other random teenage stuff scattered on the floor. Walls covered with posters. INXS. The Cure. Michael Jackson in a yellow vest. Very definite. Or should I say &quot;groovy?&quot; Did they say that in the 80s?</p>

<p>An interrupt comes through. &quot;ATLANTA COMPLETELY DESTROYED IN FULL-SCALE--&quot; I use my illegal bypass to cut off all interrupts. Ugh. I hate sports interrupts. I&#39;ll have to figure out how to change that setting.</p>

<p>I notice a can of Pepsi Free sitting on my nightstand. I pick it up. Still cold. I crack it open and smell it, and the fizz tickles my nose. It really smells like soda! I take a sip. Wow. Hmm. Not very good. Maybe it&#39;s a low quality render. Or maybe I just don&#39;t like Pepsi Free. Still, it&#39;s pretty amazing to be tasting something in a feed. This was really worth it.</p>

<p>The doorbell rings somewhere downstairs. Oh, definitely! We&#39;re starting. I head towards the door and catch myself in the mirror. I&#39;m supposed to look like a girl named Brooke Shields at 18 years old. Wow, she&#39;s pretty. What a render. The eyebrows are a little intense though. I consider toning them down, but I don&#39;t want to get caught up in character design. If you change one thing, you end up changing 50 things, and it goes on forever.</p>

<p>I head out into the hallway and pause for a moment. The smell just changed. Now there&#39;s a hallway smell. Carpet and drywall. I laugh. I take a step back into the bedroom, and the bedroom smell returns instantly. I step into the hallway again. Hallway smell. Bedroom smell. Hallway smell. Bedroom Smell. I snicker at this. The smell changes just like that. Why they can&#39;t make it more natural? What a give-away. Oh, well.</p>

<p>I head down the stairs. The furniture in the front hall looks really cheesy. I pick up a lamp and toss it at the wall. It smashes apart, and the bulb explodes with a spark. I look at the shards. There&#39;s bits of powder and all sorts of little details. Yow. Very certain.</p>

<p>&quot;Undo that,&quot; I say, and the lamp fades away and reappears on the side table.</p>

<p>I open the front door. A guy stands there with swept back blonde hair and a baggy red and black jacket with the collar popped and the sleeves rolled up. Nice. He gives me a killer smile and says, &quot;Hey babe. What took you so long?&quot;</p>

<p>A blast of electric guitar hits me, and the guy floats up out over the front lawn, becoming two stories tall and striking a sexy pose. Colors fill the night sky. Sparkling starlight showers him, and synth beat kicks in. An announcer shouts, &quot;Corey Lancer! High-school hotshot and rock n&#39; roll renegade! He&#39;s a fast talker with a slick attitude, a guy who can make anything happen. All the girls want him, but all he wants is one thing: the Ferrari 288 GTO.&quot; A red sports car comes flying out of the sky and does crazy circles around Corey while he strikes more sexy poses and the music thumps.  &quot;It&#39;s the fastest street-legal car in existence. Only 272 produced. This is Corey&#39;s dream, Corey&#39;s obsession, Corey&#39;s life. He&#39;ll do anything to get one, and he needs your help! Can you get the car? Can you win his heart? Are you ready for <em>80s Turbo Ascension</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm. Shit. I should&#39;ve looked the summary closer. I&#39;m not really into cars, and this doesn&#39;t really seem like a very interesting narrative. Still, Corey is really well rendered. Blonde hair, blue eyes. A bit of mischief in his smile. I like it. I wonder if he&#39;ll be controlled by an AI or a Filipino. He floats back down to me and returns to normal size.</p>

<p>&quot;So what&#39;s up,&quot; he said, with a devilish little grin. Wow, this is A stuff.</p>

<p>&quot;Just doing my hair,&quot; I say, flicking my huge brown mane off my shoulder. This Brooke Shields lady has an absurd amount of hair.</p>

<p>&quot;You chicks,&quot; Corey says, leaning forward and giving me a kiss.</p>

<p>His mouth tastes like bubble gum. The kiss feels perfect. Yow. Just definitely. I feel Corey&#39;s chest through his shirt. Skinny, but nice. I think about toning him up a bit. Nah, it&#39;s better to just go with his default settings.</p>

<p>&quot;So, listen, there&#39;s a race tonight at the SpeedMaxx track,&quot; Corey says in his cute California accent. &quot;The Crystal Cobras put out a challenge and they&#39;re taking all comers. The prize is--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t really like racing.&quot;</p>

<p>Corey thinks for a moment, a character animation. He looks cute thinking, his sharp eyebrows pressed together. Now he&#39;s taking too long, and it&#39;s getting awkward. I think he&#39;s controlled by a Filipino. Or maybe there&#39;s lag. He snaps back into action.</p>

<p>&quot;OK, listen. There&#39;s going to be a dance-off at the Club Heatwave. The Crystal Cobras put out a challenge, and they&#39;re taking all comers. The prize is $100,000.&quot;</p>

<p>Dancing? Yeah, that would be one way to try out my body. &quot;Sounds groovy,&quot; I say.</p>

<p>But I can&#39;t help but think of another way to give this body a test drive. I slip my hand down into my tight purple skirt and feel my pussy. Oh, yeeks. They really have everything working down there. Should I do it already? Just five minutes into the narrative? Oh, why not? Everybody does it right away. Corey looks really good. I wonder what kind of cock they rendered him with. But no, I should at least go half an hour without slutting it up. Dancing will be fun.</p>

<p>Corey holds out his arm like a gentleman, and I take it. He leads me down the front walk towards his car, a smeary old junk ride with dents and rust all over it.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, hon. It&#39;s only temporary,&quot; Corey says as we come up on the car. &quot;I promise you, by the end of this week, I&#39;m going to have a Ferrari 288 GTO, the fastest street-legal car in the world. It&#39;s my dream. It&#39;s my obsession. I&#39;ll do anything to--&quot;</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not listening. There is something in the bushes by the road. I wonder if this is actually one of those fake-out horror narratives. I really hate scary stuff. I bend over and look into the bushes. A pair of shining eyes stare back at me. Eww. What the hell? There&#39;s an old naked lady hiding in the bushes.</p>
