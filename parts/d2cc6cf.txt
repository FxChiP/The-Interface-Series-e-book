Basically, when you look at the stories of Elizabeth Bathory's behavior, it seems like she is trying to build a *flesh interface*. But it is known that in order to invent a *flesh interface*, one must be under the influence of LSD for extended periods. As LSD hadn't been invented during her life, it's probably just a coincidence. Still a tantalizing theory, though.
