We went to somewhere I could not enter the Feed Realm. I had my jack battery pulled by Ben, and now we are somewhere with no Interface Technology. VR barely exists. 

But, Shawn mentioned an abandoned warehouse with cages filled with bones. Children's bones. How many children were kidnapped in this dimension to create a working *flesh interface*? It is still happening now. 

I'm a idiot, a damned fool. An airheaded girl. What was I thinking dancing with Fireflies and making love under the stars.

It is obvious to me now. It should have been obvious all along. Q is going to exist in this dimensions timeline. Q might already exist and is spreading herself in a Supernatural way. 

Children. Like I was. I am going to throw up. 

Nick needs to find that warehouse. NO excuses. And NO drinking.  

We can stop this. The Fascistic Singularity can be stopped here. There is still time. 

This is why we were pulled here!
