<div class="md"><p>We went to somewhere I could not enter the Feed Realm. I had my jack battery pulled by Ben, and now we are somewhere with no Interface Technology. VR barely exists. </p>

<p>But, Shawn mentioned an abandoned warehouse with cages filled with bones. Children&#39;s bones. How many children were kidnapped in this dimension to create a working <em>flesh interface</em>? It is still happening now. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a idiot, a damned fool. An airheaded girl. What was I thinking dancing with Fireflies and making love under the stars.</p>

<p>It is obvious to me now. It should have been obvious all along. Q is going to exist in this dimensions timeline. Q might already exist and is spreading herself in a Supernatural way. </p>

<p>Children. Like I was. I am going to throw up. </p>

<p>Nick needs to find that warehouse. NO excuses. And NO drinking.  </p>

<p>We can stop this. The Fascistic Singularity can be stopped here. There is still time. </p>

<p>This is why we were pulled here!</p>
