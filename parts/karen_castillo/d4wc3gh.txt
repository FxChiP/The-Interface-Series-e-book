> It's the end of the firefly season here but I hope you can still enjoy them where you are.  They're one of the few things that make the summer heat and humidity bearable.  Fireflies and peaches.  Did you have fireflies in the feedrealm? 

Dancing naked under the stars with Fireflies around you is something I believe every woman should experience. With a bottle of cold water and chilled fruit and a large blanket to rest on. I know I enjoyed it last night with Ben. 

>Also, what does EYE mean?

That is Gabriella's doing. She picks up on breadcrumbs and leaves them just as often. She is *scary* smart, but plays dumb. Smart, but in a *strange* way. If you have ever met a person like that face to face you understand what I am implying. It explains why *those two* get along. I would like to meet her in the future. 

I've seen photos of her face and she looks as if she has been in a hygiene bed most of her life. Smooth for someone her age, and a sly smile that doesn't touch her cold green-blue eyes. Eyes that have no wrinkles around them for someone almost 48 years old. I would not be surprised if she is a *jumper*. She pointed me to that sub-reddit a couple of weeks ago, and mentioned Meta Probability Manipulation. 

She was right. That scares me.
