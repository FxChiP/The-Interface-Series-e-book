<div class="md"><p>I am currently in an opposite jump now. Here. </p>

<p>What I need to know is can an instance reassemble the homogenous nature of the multiverse by stopping an event that should have never happened? This event must be eradicated in the ripple, but all other fractals can remain. </p>

<p>Because although there are universes/timelines where this event does not occur, the instances in which it happens ripples over into those, and there is no barrier. There is no dam to stop the waves spillover in the future.  </p>
