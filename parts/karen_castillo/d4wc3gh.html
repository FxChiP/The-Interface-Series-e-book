<p>It&#39;s the end of the firefly season here but I hope you can still enjoy them where you are.  They&#39;re one of the few things that make the summer heat and humidity bearable.  Fireflies and peaches.  Did you have fireflies in the feedrealm? </p>

<p>Dancing naked under the stars with Fireflies around you is something I believe every woman should experience. With a bottle of cold water and chilled fruit and a large blanket to rest on. I know I enjoyed it last night with Ben. </p>

<p>Also, what does EYE mean?</p>

<p>That is Gabriella&#39;s doing. She picks up on breadcrumbs and leaves them just as often. She is <em>scary</em> smart, but plays dumb. Smart, but in a <em>strange</em> way. If you have ever met a person like that face to face you understand what I am implying. It explains why <em>those two</em> get along. I would like to meet her in the future. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen photos of her face and she looks as if she has been in a hygiene bed most of her life. Smooth for someone her age, and a sly smile that doesn&#39;t touch her cold green-blue eyes. Eyes that have no wrinkles around them for someone almost 48 years old. I would not be surprised if she is a <em>jumper</em>. She pointed me to that sub-reddit a couple of weeks ago, and mentioned Meta Probability Manipulation. </p>

<p>She was right. That scares me.  </p>
