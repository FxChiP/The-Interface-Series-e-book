<div class="md"><p>Is this outcome possible? Can a rippled-mirror effect be created using a narrative in one timeline with a positive outcome? Or will the fractal nature of the multiverse prevent this outcome? I need the wave pattern to spread out evenly regardless of irregularities due to the multiverse homogeneity being disrupted by a absolute event roughly 25 years in the future in my universe?</p>

<p>Serious theories would be appreciated.</p>
