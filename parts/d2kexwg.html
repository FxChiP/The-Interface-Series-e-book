<div class="md"><p>How do I explain mother? What was she?</p>

<p>Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη, ἡ μήτηρ τῶν πορνῶν καὶ τῶν βδελυγμάτων τῆς γῆς.</p>

<p>I used to lie in my bed, the blinds pulled against the summer sunlight, listening to the sounds of other kids playing outside. I lay there for hours, not sleeping, wondering who had made mother.</p>

<p>She was made from all different sorts of animal parts. One of her feet was big, heavy hoof. The other was a tiny little kitty cat paw. I could hear her clumping around downstairs. Her smell, the smell of cigarettes and disease, was everywhere in the house, pooling in the darkness.</p>

<p>Slowly, night would come, and I would imagine floating out of my window, floating up into the deep starry blue, looking down at all the houses shrinking into tiny boxes, the clean breeze blowing on my face.</p>

<p>Oh, how I would cry in my little bed.</p>

<p>I was very young when mother first came. I had another mommy before her, a good one, who wore pearls and had a voice like music. Then one day, I got sick, a fever. I was crying all day, and it went on for weeks. I guess my first mommy couldn&#39;t take it anymore. One night, she left forever. When I came down for breakfast the next morning, this new thing was waiting for me in the kitchen.</p>

<p>At least, I think that&#39;s what happened.</p>

<p>Mother never talked. She just snorted and made horse sounds. Awful. Her parts were sewn together with yarn, and there were patches of wet burlap. I didn&#39;t see her eyes until she had been there almost a year. Have you ever seen horse eyes up close? They&#39;re like goat&#39;s eyes. They have a sideways pupil.</p>

<p>I would come home after school, and there would be kids sitting at the breakfast table. She gave them medicine so they did whatever she wanted them to. It made them just sit there, staring and shaking. Then she would take them down in the basement and make them into things.</p>

<p>She tried to make me do it too, but I didn&#39;t want to. I realized she was afraid of the Bible. I realized it had power. Blood power. When I read it to her, her different pieces would shudder and pull apart, and she would howl like a wolf, and blood would run from her segments. The Bible brought transmissions from the cross that floated in the red summer sky.</p>

<p>Everything in time is arranged around the epicenter wherein the nail drove into Christ&#39;s hand. Lines of possibilities radiate outward from it. Kingdoms rise and fall, men grow and die like flowers in a field.</p>

<p>τὸ θηρίον ὃ εἶδες ἦν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν, καὶ μέλλει ἀναβαίνειν</p>
