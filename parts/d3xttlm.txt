    How the flesh dances and how the flesh plays
    
    How the flesh toils and spins through its days
    
    See the flesh happy and strapping and young
    
    See the flesh sagging and dragging and glum

&nbsp;
    
    Sssssshhhhh....

&nbsp;
    
    Hear now the giggling
    
    See shadows grow
    
    Step down the hallway
    
    Each door aglow
    
    Watch now the ceiling
    
    Sweet cradle rocks
    
    Who made these puppets?
    
    Who made this clock?
    
&nbsp;
    
    Ancient hand on the cradle
    
    Withered lips form a song
    
    Golden wheels spinning backward
    
    Withered hand becomes young
    
&nbsp;
    
    The hands can spin
    
    Spin then slow
    
    The clock is wound afresh
    
    But is the key
    
    Turned this time
    
    By fingers made of flesh?
