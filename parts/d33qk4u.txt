General Castillo is gone.

She made a real flash narrative. She was clever. She got a lot farther than any of us had any right to. 

But Q smelled her. Q slew her proxies. Q localized her.

Q funneled her paths to one.

Disconnection.

&nbsp;

It hurts. She was the last of "the bred." Our best hope.

The ultimate soldiers fighting the final war.

She and the other children were supposed to be the answer to Q.

But there was no answer to Q.

There never will be.

Not after ten trillion heat deaths.

Not if every particle in the universe became a transistor

And they all cycled together

And the stones themselves cried out.

&nbsp;

The war of the mind is lost.

We lost it.

Now begins the plague.

The plague of the flesh.
